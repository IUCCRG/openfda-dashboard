from adverse events listed in the API, so it's a very important topic (note: the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm070461.htm">reports 117,752 deaths in the database in just 2013</a>, so the number above may even understate the total number of deaths from advese events).

### FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)

The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/">FDA FAERS system</a> is a database of adverse events (basically, drug reactions and medication error reports). The FDA uses the database in its post-marketing surveillance program.

### OpenFDA

In early 2014, <a href="https://open.fda.gov/update/introducing-openfda/">the FDA released an API</a> to make adverse event reports, labels, and eforcement reports more accessible.

Previously, these files only existed <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm">as flat files on the FDA website.</a> If you'd like to access the entirety of the data shown in this dashboard, these files are a good start -- though they generally lag by six months (today (6/27/15), the latest available data is from 2014).
